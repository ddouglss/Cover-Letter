  <h2>Junior Full Stack Developer | C# and .NET | Scalable Solutions, AWS Cloud, and Docker</h2>
    
  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
    
  <p>My name is Douglas Souza Silva, I am 25 years old and I have a degree as a Technician in Systems Development, currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I am a junior full stack developer specialized in creating robust and scalable solutions using C# and the complete .NET ecosystem, including the latest versions of .NET.</p>

  <p>I have experience in software development using frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Razor, .NET Aspire, and .NET MAUI, as well as integrating projects with databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Full stack development allows me to create modern solutions, with ASP.NET Core serving as the backbone for high-performance APIs and web applications.</p>

  <p>Integration with Blazor facilitates the creation of interactive interfaces for both the front-end and back-end using C#. For cross-platform development, I use .NET MAUI, allowing the creation of applications for desktops and mobile devices from a single codebase.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I have knowledge of AWS Cloud, Azure, and Docker, always seeking to optimize infrastructure and deployment processes. I use Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for relational data management and follow Clean Code practices and architectural best practices.</p>

  <p>In web development, I work with Razor Pages and the MVC pattern to manage dynamic pages and separate business logic from presentation. When necessary, I use Angular to develop Single Page Applications (SPAs) integrated with the backend in ASP.NET Core.</p>

  <p>I adopt agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to ensure efficient deliveries, continuous learning, and a focus on creating solutions that deliver real value to customers.</p>

  <p>Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.</p>
